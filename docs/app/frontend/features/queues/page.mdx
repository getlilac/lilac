# Queues

The Queues feature is responsible for displaying and managing job queues. Queues are used to manage job scheduling and resource allocation.

## Key Components

### Queues Page
The main page for the Queues feature is located at `/queues`. It displays a list of all available queues in a card format. From this page, you can create new queues and navigate to the details page for each queue.

### Queue Details Page
The details page for a queue provides more in-depth information, including:
- **Overview**: General information about the queue.
- **Jobs**: A list of jobs that are currently in the queue.

### Creating a Queue
You can create a new queue by clicking the "Create Queue" button on the Queues page. This will open a modal where you can specify the queue's name, priority, and the cluster it belongs to.
