# Clusters

The Clusters feature is responsible for displaying and managing compute clusters in the platform. It provides a centralized view of all available clusters, allowing users to monitor their status, manage their configurations, and view associated jobs.

## Key Components

The feature is composed of several key components:

- **Clusters Page:** The main page that lists all available compute clusters. It provides a high-level overview of each cluster, including its name, status, and the number of nodes.
- **Cluster Details Page:** A dedicated page that provides detailed information about a specific cluster. This includes the cluster's configuration, a list of its nodes, and a list of jobs that have run on the cluster.
- **Create Cluster Modal:** A modal that allows users to create a new compute cluster. It includes a form for specifying the cluster's configuration, such as its name, and other relevant settings.
- **Delete Cluster Modal:** A modal that allows users to delete an existing compute cluster.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive solution for managing compute clusters in the platform.
