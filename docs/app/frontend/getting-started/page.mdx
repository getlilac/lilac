# Getting Started with the Frontend

This guide will walk you through the process of running the frontend by itself. This is typically done for development purposes. In a production setting see the quick start guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm**: npm is distributed with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Create an environment file**

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory. You can do this by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Set the API endpoint**

    Open the `.env` file and set the `VITE_LILAC_API_ENDPOINT` variable to the URL of your running backend API.

    ```env
    VITE_LILAC_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8081
    ```

## Running the Development Server

Once you have completed the installation and configuration steps, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:8080` by default. You can now access the frontend in your web browser.
