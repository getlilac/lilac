# Getting Started with the Backend

This guide will walk you through the recommended process of setting up and running the Lilac backend services using Docker Compose. This is the fastest and easiest way to get started.

### 1. Create the Configuration Files

Before you can run the backend, you need to create two configuration files by copying the provided examples.

```bash
# For the backend server configuration
cp ./backend/lilac.example.toml ./backend/lilac.toml

# For the frontend API endpoint
cp ./docker/.env.example ./docker/.env
```

**Important:** If you are running Lilac on a remote server, you must edit the `docker/.env` file and replace `http://localhost:8081` with the public IP address or domain name of your server. This ensures the frontend can communicate with the backend.

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

With the configuration in place, you can now run the entire Lilac platform with a single command. This will start the backend server, the web UI, and a local PostgreSQL database.

```bash
docker compose --env-file ./docker/.env -f ./docker/docker-compose.dev.yml --profile postgres up
```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8081`, and the web UI will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Bringing Your Own Database

If you would prefer to use your own PostgreSQL database, you can modify the `LILAC__DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file to point to your database. Then, you can start the platform without the local database:

```bash
docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up
